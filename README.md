## Disclaimer: ##

These are purely 'as is' and are my artefacts that I use for demos - if you find them useful, then that's great....if you want to use these as a basis to build your own demos, that's great too!

There is no support for these either from myself or IBM and these are in no way 'Official IBM' demos or artefacts.
